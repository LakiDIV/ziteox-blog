OpenAI just turned ChatGPT from a smart chatbot into a **real digital assistant**.

Meet **ChatGPT Agent** — a new feature that gives ChatGPT the power to *think, plan, and act*. It can browse websites, fill out forms, run code, and even generate reports or slide decks — all without you lifting a finger.

Forget switching tabs or doing everything step-by-step. Just give it a task, and it handles the rest.

## What Can ChatGPT Agent Actually Do?

The Agent blends browsing, research, and execution. A few wild examples:

- ✈️ **Plan a trip:** Tell it your travel dates and preferences. It checks your calendar, compares flight options, weather, prices — and books the best one.
- 🍽️ **Book dinner:** It finds a free evening, checks restaurants near you, scans reviews, and makes the reservation.
- 📊 **Generate reports:** Upload your sales data and ask it to create a summary slide deck — it’ll analyze, format, and give you a downloadable presentation.

You give it the *intent* — it handles the execution from A to Z.

## Why It’s a Big Deal

ChatGPT Agent combines the brains of past OpenAI tools (like Deep Research and Operator) into one **autonomous system**. It can now:

- Browse like a user (even click, scroll, log in)
- Execute code in a secure terminal
- Use your Google Calendar, Drive, Gmail, and more via connectors
- Create files (spreadsheets, slide decks, reports) as output

And it does this with **zero micromanagement** from you.

It's the first time we’re seeing an AI assistant that doesn’t just suggest — it **does**.

## Who Can Use It?

Agent is now rolling out to:

- **ChatGPT Pro** (400 tasks/month)
- **Plus** and **Team** (40 tasks/month)

Enterprise and education support is coming soon. Just type `/agent` in ChatGPT or find it in the Tools dropdown to get started.

## Safety and Control Built In

Don’t worry — it’s not going rogue.

- You stay in the loop. It **asks for permission** before sensitive steps.
- There's a **watch mode** for higher-risk actions.
- You can **pause or stop** the task anytime.
- Every step is **logged and reviewable** — full transparency.

It’s powerful, but you’re always the one in control.

## Summary

OpenAI just gave ChatGPT superpowers. You can now ask it to do the kind of stuff you’d usually do across 5 tabs and 30 minutes — and it delivers. From booking, researching, planning to file generation, this is your first real taste of AI *action*.
